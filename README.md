## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I learned about Flexbox and various CSS properties, which helped me build this project. I practiced centering elements on a page and gained valuable hands-on experience with Flexbox.

```css
html, body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
