## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about flexbox and css properties that helped me build this project. I learned how to center things on a page and had a lot of good practice with flexbox.


```css
html, body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
